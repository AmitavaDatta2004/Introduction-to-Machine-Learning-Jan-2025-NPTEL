You're absolutely right to ask for a recheck! Let's carefully revisit **Question 6** to ensure we get it correct this time.

---

### **Question 6 Revisited:**

We are given a Bayesian classifier for a 5-class classification problem with the following class-conditioned densities \( f_k(x) \) and prior probabilities \( \pi_k \). The posterior probability for class \( k \) is given by:
\[
P(k | x) \propto f_k(x) \cdot \pi_k
\]

Given:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
\hline
f_k(x) & 0.15 & 0.20 & 0.05 & 0.50 & 0.01 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We need to evaluate the statements:

1. **The predicted label at \( x \) will always be class 4.**
   - **False**: The predicted label depends on both \( f_k(x) \) and \( \pi_k \). Without knowing \( \pi_k \), we cannot assert that class 4 will always be the predicted label. For example, if \( \pi_4 \) is very small, class 4 might not be the predicted label.

2. **If \( 2\pi_i \leq \pi_{i+1} \forall i \in \{1, \ldots, 4\} \), the predicted class must be class 4.**
   - **True**: This condition implies that the prior probabilities are increasing (\( \pi_1 \leq \pi_2 \leq \pi_3 \leq \pi_4 \leq \pi_5 \)). Given that \( f_4(x) = 0.50 \) is the highest, the posterior probability for class 4 will be the highest, making it the predicted class.

3. **If \( \pi_i \geq \frac{3}{2}\pi_{i+1} \forall i \in \{1, \ldots, 4\} \), the predicted class must be class 1.**
   - **False**: This condition implies that the prior probabilities are decreasing (\( \pi_1 \geq \frac{3}{2}\pi_2 \geq \frac{3}{2}\pi_3 \geq \frac{3}{2}\pi_4 \geq \frac{3}{2}\pi_5 \)). However, even if \( \pi_1 \) is large, \( f_1(x) = 0.15 \) is not the highest. If \( \pi_4 \) is sufficiently large, class 4 could still have a higher posterior probability than class 1.

4. **The predicted label at \( x \) can never be class 5.**
   - **False**: Although \( f_5(x) = 0.01 \) is the lowest, if \( \pi_5 \) is sufficiently large, class 5 could still be the predicted label.

### **Correct Options for Question 6:**
- **Statement 2** is true.
- **Statements 1, 3, and 4** are false.

---

### **Final Summary of Correct Options:**

- **Question 6:** Only statement 2 is true.
- **Question 7:** Statements 2 and 4 are true.

Thank you for your patience! The corrected analysis for **Question 6** is now accurate. ðŸ˜Š
